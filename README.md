# winrate
Accurate winrate calculator using raw JSON BGStats data.

Currently not yet accurate, just spits out actual and expected numbers of wins. Next step is to put together a whitelist of balanced games.

Execute with:

`winrate.py <json dump file path>`

You can also invoke the parser directly using:

`statsparser.py`

and following the prompt to enter a file path. This is really just for testing that it works.
